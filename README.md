# Aerial-Delivery-system
Functionality of the Project

This project demonstrates a Drone Delivery Simulation with the following features:

Predefined Route Simulation – The drone automatically moves between two fixed locations (e.g., City A → City B).

No-Fly Zone Detection – Certain areas are marked as restricted, and the drone avoids these zones while moving.

Timed Movement – The drone takes a fixed time (e.g., 10 seconds) to reach the destination and another 10 seconds to return.

Visualization – A map interface displays:

The starting and ending points.

The drone’s real-time position.

Highlighted no-fly zones.

How to Open the Website

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git

2. Go to the Project Folder

cd <your-repo-name>

3. Open the Website

There are two ways to run it:

Option A: Using Live Server (Recommended)

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.


2. Install the Live Server extension (if not installed).


3. Right-click index.html → Open with Live Server.


4. The site will launch in your browser (usually at http://127.0.0.1:5500/).



Option B: Open Directly in Browser

1. Locate the index.html file inside the project folder.


2. Double-click it, and it will open in your default browser.



4. Explore the Simulation

A map will load in the browser.

A drone icon will move along its delivery route{show the demo}.

No-fly zones will be highlighted and avoided by the drone.
